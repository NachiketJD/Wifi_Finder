import subprocess
 
nw = subprocess.check_output(['netsh', 'wlan', 'show', 'network']).decode('ascii')# this object, nw, contains all the network information, including the SSID of each network, this is the name of the network this done using the netsh command in the command prompt, the wlan show network command shows all the available networks in the system, the decode function is used to convert the output to a string, and the split function is used to split the output into a list of strings, each string represents a network. This is done becoz the output of the netsh command is in bytes and we need to convert it to string to 
print(nw)
